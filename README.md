# NLP Models

This repository hosts a few NLP models, with each one implemented in one Jupyter Notebook. You can download these Notbooks and upload to your Google Drive, then run them on Google Colab. Each Notebook is self-explanatory and self-contained (no dependency on other modules)

The PDF file "Word2Vec â€“ Numerical Optimization Approach" is a sketch of word2vec algorithm through the conventional numerical optimization approach insetad of through neural networks. Readers who are comfortable with matrix calculus will find this writing helpful for understanding the word2vec algorithm at a deeper level.
